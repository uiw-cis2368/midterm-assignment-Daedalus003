      <h2 class="bio">A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a Programming Major and have been interest in the field since sophmore year of highschool when I found out I could work from home and drink coffee all day. I'm really more interested in the backend development as I'm not too creative when it comes to design as you can tell from this website. I graduated from an early college highschool

        so I've been taking college classes since I was about 14 so the basics are nothing new. I will say the whole learning MLA, APA, and Chicago format with research papers isn't that helpful to me anymore since most of the things I type up now are scripts and programs. I truly do enjoy the work I do now and how it kinda is just problem solving all 

        day, everyday. More about me stuff is that I enjoy listening to music and finding new music, a friend actually recently put me onto k-pop and it is kinda cool to listen to while coding bc it makes a happy rythem without having lyrics I can learn and sing to. I also have two cats that are truly day and night, as one hates people and the other is an attention hog.

      <h2 class="CareerGoals">My Goals</h2>
      <p>My goals are to get somewhere in software development, this class has had me thinking about web development but I think I lack the design creativity. Working from a desk has been my goal since I was small since I grew up with all the men in my family having bad knees and spine issues from working manual labor becase it paid better. So, instead of that future I decided

        that my whole life was going to be spent just trying to make the most money without risking my body. I don't need a fancy title, or a bunch of respect, I just want to work on solving problems in more efficient ways and learn how these lovely machines and applications that we all use in our daily lives work. I've though of a future in gamedevelopment since I've been really good 

        at C based languages so far in my academic career but truly machine learning has caught my attention since Professor Ammari brought it up in my scripting class.
